# DevOrNot

Use the wisdom of the crowd to determine if an NPM package should be installed as a `dependency` or as a `devDependency`. Data provided by over a million GitHub repos.

Sample usage:

```
DevOrNot.exe C:\Users\user\project\package.json

"react" is installed as a devDependency, but it is usually installed as a dependency (consensus: 91.6%)
```
